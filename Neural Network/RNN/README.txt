Welcome to my Recurrent Neural Network in Java!

My name is Diaz Agasatya, this repository is dedicated to an implementation of Recurrent Neural Network in
Java using intelliJ IDEA. The Recurrent Neural Network sole purpose is to generate a 200 character text in
respect to George R R Martin's style of writing in his famously known story "The Ice Dragon".

The implementation of this program is done through the model of a fully connected Neural Network with hidden states connected in the middle of the network to mimic the biological memorization during the process of training. This implementation is based upon the paper done by Andrej Kaparthy who is the leading AI engineer in Tesla Motors. The Inputs are the characters from the book "The Ice Dragon", where the network learns the mapping and patterns of which the next step of the process should implement. Through back propagation, the network learns the errors that it made at the end of the process where it generated 250 characters to mimic the patter of the book it feeds as an input. The model trained for about 2.5 days approximately 58 hours to fully generate a full sentence that is very similar to the book "The Ice Dragon".
