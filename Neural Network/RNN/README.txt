Welcome to my Recurrent Neural Network in Java!

My name is Diaz Agasatya, this repository is dedicated to an implementation of Recurrent Neural Network in Java
using intelliJ IDEA. The Recurrent Neural Network sole purpose is to generate a 200 character text in respect to
George R R Martin's style of writing in his famously known story "The Ice Dragon".
